# SensorLibrary
This is a lib put together for the FinalProgect 1 class.
Its basic in its functions but should streamline the programing process.

The only things I could not add due to some compilation definition error was the IRremote.h functions
This was added in the .ino file so you can see how its done but dont need to be used and will not be carried over if you copy the Functions library.

## Pin locations
All the pins are defined in the Functions.cpp file and should be changed before use.
These Functions may be component specific so dont expect it to work immediatly if you didnt get the ELEGOO kit.

Feel free to yoink the code for your own purpouses and change it to suit your needs.
This code still works even if you dont use all the sensors without removing them.
