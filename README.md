# SensorLibrary
This is a lib put together for the FinalProgect 1 class.
Its basic in its functions but should streamline the programing process.

### Pin locations
All the pins are defined in the Functions.cpp file and should be changed before use.
These Functions may be component specific so dont expect it to work immediatly if you didnt get the ELEGOO kit.
